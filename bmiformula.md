Body Mass Index (BMI) – Standard Definition and Limitations
The standard BMI formula uses only weight and height:
Formula: BMI = weight(kg) ÷ [height(m)]²
cdc.gov
. (In U.S. units, BMI ≈ [weight(lb) / height(in)²]×703.)
Adult Categories: WHO/CDC define cutoffs (underweight <18.5; normal 18.5–24.9; overweight 25–29.9; obese ≥30)
en.wikipedia.org
cdc.gov
. Importantly, adult BMI categories are the same for all ages ≥20 and for both sexes
cdc.gov
.
Limitations: BMI does not account for body composition, fat distribution, or demographic factors. Women and older adults generally have higher body fat at a given BMI than young men
med.stanford.edu
. As the American Medical Association notes, BMI “does not account for differences across … sexes, genders, and age-span”
med.stanford.edu
. Experts emphasize that improved metrics should incorporate age, sex, fitness, and metabolic factors for more accurate risk assessment

. In practice, this means BMI alone is used with caution: additional measures (e.g. waist circumference) are often taken into account, and BMI cutoffs may be interpreted differently by age/sex.
BMI Interpretation by Age and Sex
Children & Teens (2–19 years): Compute BMI as usual (kg/m²), then compare to age- and sex-specific percentiles
cdc.gov
cdc.gov
. CDC/WHO growth charts rank a child’s BMI against peers of the same sex and age. For example, BMI ≥95th percentile for a boy/girl is considered obese
cdc.gov
. (Percentile-based categories: <5th = underweight; 5th–84th healthy; 85th–94th overweight; ≥95th obese
cdc.gov
.) Thus the calculation is unchanged, but interpretation explicitly includes sex and age
cdc.gov
.
Adults (20+ years): The formula is the same for all adults, and guidelines use the same BMI thresholds for both sexes and all adult ages
cdc.gov
. In other words, adults do not use percentiles – a given BMI has the same category whether male or female (age 20 or 70)
cdc.gov
. (However, clinicians note that e.g. an older adult’s height loss can inflate BMI; one study suggests calculating BMI using a person’s maximum adult height (“young height”) to avoid age-related misclassification
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.) In epidemiology and medicine, BMI is often reported along with waist circumference or other measures to account for age/sex differences in body fat distribution
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
.
Sex differences: Women naturally have more body fat than men at the same BMI
med.stanford.edu
. Research acknowledges this but generally treats BMI formula identically for both sexes, instead adjusting by interpreting results. For example, some risk charts or treatments may use different BMI cut-offs for men vs women or for different age groups (often based on population studies)
med.stanford.edu
cdc.gov
. No official separate adult BMI formula by sex is mandated – BMI simply tends to overestimate obesity in muscular men and underestimate it in women.
Extended Formulas and Predictive Models
Because BMI itself is simple, researchers have proposed modified formulas or companion equations that include age and sex (often to estimate body fat rather than BMI itself):
Deurenberg’s Body-Fat Percentage Formula (1991): Relates BMI to body fat%, explicitly including age and sex
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. For adults, one validated equation is:
BF%

,
BF%=1.20×BMI+0.23×age−10.8×(sex)−5.4,
where sex = 1 for male, 0 for female
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. (Children ≤15 years have a different formula: BF% = 1.51×BMI – 0.70×age – 3.6×sex + 1.4
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.) These are prediction equations – not alternative BMI formulas – but they show how age/sex affect body fat at the same BMI.
Sex-specific BMI exponents (Feng et al. 2024): Using UK Biobank data, Feng et al. found that the optimal height exponent in BMI differed by sex: about 1.77 for males and 1.39 for females
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In other words, they proposed “new” BMI-like indices:
Male: $W/(H^{1.77})$; Female: $W/(H^{1.39})$ (where $W$=weight, $H$=height)
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
However, these adjustments only slightly reclassified some individuals and did not significantly improve prediction of body fat or mortality compared to standard BMI
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Thus conventional BMI (exponent 2 for both sexes) remains the practical standard
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
New BMI (Trefethen, 2013): To correct for height distortion, a “New BMI” uses exponent 2.5 instead of 2

. The factor 1.3 aligns this new index with traditional BMI values. This formula does not include age or sex, but it is a height-correction that partly addresses body shape differences
en.wikipedia.org
.
Relative Fat Mass (RFM): An alternative to BMI that uses waist circumference ($WC$) and height with a sex term. For example

with sex=0 for male, 1 for female. RFM estimates % body fat more directly and incorporates sex, but it is a body-fat index, not a BMI formula, and requires $WC$ measurement.
Fat Mass Index (FMI): When body fat is measured (e.g. by DXA or BIA), one can compute FMI = (fat mass in kg)/[height(m)]². This provides an age- and sex-independent index of adiposity, but it requires a fat mass measurement rather than just weight/height.
Best Practices & Proxies
Children: Always use BMI percentiles or z-scores by sex/age
cdc.gov
. Growth chart tools (CDC/WHO) incorporate sex and exact age in months.
Adults: Use standard BMI but interpret in context. The CDC/WHO cutoffs do not change with age
cdc.gov
, but clinicians may be more lenient for the elderly. Height loss can distort BMI, so using “young” height yields a corrected BMI
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Supplemental measures: Because BMI ignores fat distribution, add waist circumference or waist-height ratio. (E.g. waist≥102 cm in men or ≥88 cm in women indicates high risk
en.wikipedia.org
.) Waist-to-height ratio thresholds have been proposed by age (≈0.50 for <40y, 0.50–0.60 for 40–50y, ≥0.60 for >50y)
en.wikipedia.org
. These measures implicitly account for sex/age differences in fat distribution better than BMI alone.
Clinical judgment: Use BMI as a screening tool, not a definitive diagnosis. Age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass and fitness all matter. The AMA advises combining BMI with other risk assessments (e.g. DEXA, waist/hip ratios)
med.stanford.edu
. For example, sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) can make an older person’s BMI misleading – an elderly patient may be “overweight” by BMI but actually frail.
Summary
No single universally “adjusted” BMI formula currently integrates weight, height, sex, and age in one step. BMI itself remains weight/height², with only population-based categories using age/sex (children) or separate considerations (e.g. different cutoffs)
cdc.gov
cdc.gov
. In research and practice, adjustments are made via supplementary metrics and interpretation: e.g. converting BMI to body-fat% with age/sex formulas
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, using sex-specific exponents
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, correcting for height loss with age
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, or relying on growth charts for youths
cdc.gov
. The consensus is to view BMI as a convenient but limited index, augmented by other measures as needed
